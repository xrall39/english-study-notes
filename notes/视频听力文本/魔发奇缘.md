## Chapter 1

this is the story of how I died.

Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story.

And the truth is, it isn't even mine.

This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel

And it starts, with the sun.

Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.

And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.

It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.

Oh, you see that old woman, over there..

You might want remember her.

She's kind of important.

Well, centuries pass, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.

The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.

And the Queen, well, she was about to have a baby, but she got sick, really sick.

She was running out of time, and that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.

Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

## Chapter 2
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.

You see instead of sharing the sun's gift, this woman, **Mother Gothel**, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.

And all she had to do was sing a special song. 

**"Flower gleam and glow let your power shine. 
Make the clock reverse bring back what once was mine."**

What once was mine.

All right, you get the **gist**.

She sings to it, she turns young.

**Creepy**, right?

we've found it.

## Chapter 3
The magic of the golden flower healed the queen.

A healthy baby girl, a princess, was born.

With beautiful golden hair.

I'll give you a hint: That's **Rapunzel**.

To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.

And for that one moment, everything was perfect.

And then that moment ended.

**"Flower,gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock re... Huh!**

Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child, and just like that...gone.
