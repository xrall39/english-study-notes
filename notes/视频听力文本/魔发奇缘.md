## chapter1

this is the story of how I died.

Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story.

And the truth is, it isn't even mine.

This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel

And it starts, with the sun.

Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.

And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.

It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.

Oh, you see that old woman, over there..

You might want remember her.

She's kind of important.

Well, centuries pass, and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.

The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.

And the Queen, well, she was about to have a baby, but she got sick, really sick.

She was running out of time, and that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.

Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
